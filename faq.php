                <p>They are recognizably similar to those of other Christian denominations.</p>
                <p>The Eucharist is the primary weekly worship service.Mass/Eucharist–Celebrated at several times on Sunday and on Wednesdays as well as other occasions.  This is the sharing of a sacred meal of bread and wine in remembrance that Christ died for us. The order of service can be found in the Book of Common Prayer ( Red Book) or in service leaflets distributed to everyone.
                <p>The Eucharist/Mass includes recognizable elements for those who have belonged to other Christian denominations. It starts with a reading from the Old Testament [The Jewish Bible] and a psalm from the same source; then a reading from the New Testament [the Christian Bible] and then a reading from the Gospel, or quotes attributed to Jesus.  We say The Lord's Prayer, we greet one another with a wish for Peace, we ask God for forgiveness for our sins, we eat the bread and wine and then we thank God for all his blessings.</p>
                <p>Much of our Mass will be familiar to those who have attended Catholic services. If you are or were a Roman Catholic you will find similarities with many Episcopal beliefs and practices have common roots with the Roman Catholic Church. A major difference with Roman Catholicism is that the Episcopal Church is more democratic, governed by its Bishops and church members participating in Diocesan Conventions. They establish general guidelines among divergent opinions while maintaining common core beliefs. Episcopalians allow variances and understand human doubts without limiting us to one central authority to define and restrict permitted opinions.  See Book of Common Prayer.</p>

                    <dd>Baptism is the foundation for all future church participation and ministry. Each candidate for baptism in the Episcopal Church is to be sponsored by one or more baptized persons. Sponsors (godparents) speak on behalf of candidates for baptism who are infants or younger children and cannot speak for themselves at the Presentation and Examination of the Candidates.<dd>
                    <dd>Baptism is offered at Sunday services on designated dates. Contact Father Daniel at (201) 652-2350 or email "Daniel Gunn rector@christchurchridgewood.org" to obtain information.</dd>

                <p><strong>Family Promise</strong> - Christ Church participates in Family Promise of Bergen County's program to shelter homeless working families in a series of houses of worship, and help them become self-sufficient. We host up to four such families at our church for a week twice a year.</p>
                <p>Our families, including young and old members, join in to make and serve dinner, provide breakfast and lunch and spend time with the visiting parents and kids evenings. Each night two parish volunteers spend the night at the church. In all, dozens of parishioners and friends pitch in to make our guests  welcome and comfortable. We usually have more than enough volunteers, and we've received valuable help from others, including members of Catholic and Lutheran congregations and a group of Turkish Muslims.</p>
                <p>One Saturday afternoon month we also staff the Family Promise Family Center in Ridgewood. This "ministry of presence"  makes it possible for homeless families to have a space to spend the afternoon if and when they need it.</p>
                <p><strong>Food Pantry</strong> - St. Paul's Food Pantry located in Paterson is supported with items placed in our food collection barrels to fill its shelves staples, including pastas, rice, and cereals. Monetary donations are also accepted. Once a month, on SHARE Sunday, we stuff bills into canisters for the pantry.</p>
                <p>At Thanksgiving, we provide the makings for many St. Paul's family's dinners.</p>

                <p><strong>Animal Shelter</strong> - The RBARI, is a non-profit, no-kill shelter located in Oakland.  RBARI is dedicated to the welfare of companion animals in our community.  They protect the abandoned, abused, and unwanted animals in their care by finding kind and loving homes for them.  Cats and dogs are given food, shelter, medical treatment, and love, as well as behavioral therapy, and rehabilitation.  RBARI survives on donations, so anything that is given to this organization is greatly appreciated.  Christ Church is committed to helping RBARI ensure humane treatment, proper care, and shelter for these abandoned, abused, and unwanted animals.</p>

                        <p>Our church's stately stone exterior evokes rural England. The interior dark oak rafters, off white walls, and exquisite stained glass feels warm in winter and cool in summer. A series of memorial stained glass windows depicting the life of  Jesus line the walls of the nave; one in the vestibule shows a New Jersey evening landscape, with the sun setting and the Big Dipper rising. A dove made of Venetian crystal hangs in an intimate side chapel. The burial garth is located in a small open courtyard directly behind the altar.</p>
                        <p>Christ Church has a magnificent 3 manual, 23 rank Austin pipe organ which has an antiphonal division over the south door, including a brilliant French style Trompetteen chamade.</p>
                        <p><strong>The Great Hall</strong> is the setting for many church and community events, from receptions to musicals to a Sunday afternoon Hindu service. The air conditioned space has a curtained, lit stage and can seat 350 as an auditorium or 200 as a dining room. The hallway on the floor below the hall has rooms for Sunday school classes, a Sunday morning nursery, meetings and storage.</p>
                        <p><strong>The Guilds Room</strong> is a bright, comfortable carpeted meeting place for adult education, coffee hour, vestry meetings and other sessions.</p>
                        <p><strong>The Education Wing</strong> on  the east side of the church complex is rented by a Montessori pre-school and is used for Sunday School and Young Adult activities.</p>
                        <p><strong>The Cottage</strong>, once the rectory, is a white frame three-story house built over a century ago. Its first floor apartment houses the Sexton and has meeting rooms. A tenant occupies the upstairs apartment.</p>
                        <p><strong>The Labyrinth</strong> spirals out in paving stones outside our main side doors. It's been used, formally and informally, for contemplation and mediation.</p>
