						<h4>Father Thomas E. Mathews<br><small>Rector</small></h4>
						<p>
							Fr. Tom was recently called to Christ Church following a 10 year Rectorship at St.
							Luke’s Church, Phillipsburg and a 4 year Assistant Rector position at Grace Church,
							Madison. He is a “cradle Episcopalian” who attended St. John’s in Boonton where he
							and his wife, Tanya, developed a vibrant youth ministry and where Fr. Tom also
							served on the Vestry before seminary.
						</p>
						<p>
							He grew up in Parsippany, and graduated from The College of NJ with a B.S. in
							Chemistry and a minor in Psych, opening the door to work for four years in both
							Fragrance and Oncology research. From 2000-2003, he attended Episcopal Divinity
							School in Cambridge, MA (now EDS @ UTS), where he graduated with Honors for his
							M. Div. Thesis on the Apostle Paul.
						</p>
						<p>
							He enjoys all aspects of parish ministry and administration, and feels especially
							called to the formation of community and church as a “family.” In his pastime, he
							and Tanya love to spend time with their smart, funny and caring daughters, Ava and
							Elyse. He enjoys pop culture and reading, watching football, attending concerts and biking.
