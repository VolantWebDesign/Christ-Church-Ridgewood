        Luke’s Gospel heard today recounts the story of Jesus’ healing of a great multitude from all Judea, Jerusalem and throughout the region.  We hear that all who touched Jesus were healed by the power emanating from him. The hymns and Offertory anthem sung today all point to his extraordinary capacity to heal in the many Gospel stories and its relevance for us today.

        The Gospel Hymn “Heal me, hands of Jesus,” was written by the late 20th century Anglican clergyman Michael Arnold Perry, a prolific hymn writer, whose many hymns were published by Jubilate, a major publisher of contemporary hymnody in England. It is included in the Episcopal hymnal “Wonder, Love and Praise,” a supplement to The Hymnal 1982. The composer Carl W. Haywood, a major contributor to many musical publications of the Episcopal Church, composed the very attractive tune. Dr. Haywood serves as Director of Choral Activities at Norfolk State University in VA.

        At the conclusion of the service, we’ll sing “All my hope on God is founded,” a hymn by Robert Seymour Bridges, the late 19th and early 20th century British poet and translator. The tune, Michael, by the great English composer Herbert Howells, was composed to honor the memory of Howells’ son, who died of polio at age nine. It is remarkable that a father’s grief can be transformed into such triumphal joy in this great testament to the power of healing.
